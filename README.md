# Movie-Database
This repository showcases my skills in relational database management by designing and implementing a Movie Database inspired by IMDb and Rotten Tomatoes. The project involves structuring, querying, and optimizing a relational database to store comprehensive information about movies, directors, actors, and more.

## Project Overview
The Movie Database contains the following details:

* Movies: Title, release date, rating, budget, gross revenue.
* Directors:
  * First name, surname
  * Year of birth, location of birth (city, state, country)

* Actors:
  * First name, surname
  * Date of birth, location of birth (city, state, country)
  * Eye color (if known)

* Movie Genre: Type (Comedy, Romance, Drama, etc.) with descriptions.
* Education: Universities and departments attended by actors and directors, including details such as student count, description, private/public status, and representative color.
* Cinemas & Showtimes: Name of cinema, ticket price, location, cinema hall type (Regular, IMAX, 3D), showtimes, and duration.
* Awards: Information on awards won by movies (e.g., Oscars) and categories (Best Movie, Best Director, Best Actor, Best Visual Effects, etc.).

## Technologies Used
* SQL
* Relational Database Management Systems (RDBMS)
* Database Normalization
* Query Optimization
* Data Modeling (pgModeler or other modeling tools)

## Features
* Schema Design & Normalization: Properly structured tables to avoid redundancy.
* Advanced SQL Queries: Includes complex queries with JOINs, subqueries, and aggregate functions.
* Data Integrity & Relationships: Foreign key constraints to ensure consistency.
* Efficient Data Retrieval: Optimized indexes for performance.

## How to Use
1. Clone the repository
2. Open the database files using an appropriate SQL database management tool (e.g., PostgreSQL, MySQL Workbench, SQLite).
3. Run the queries to explore and analyze the movie data.
